# VotingFromJail

A public code repository for the NYU Public Safety Lab analysis of voting from jail.

This analysis draws on individual-level identified data from two sources: 1) New York University Public Safety Lab Jail Data Initiative jail roster records (https://jaildatainitiative.org/) and 2) L2 voter file records (https://l2-data.com/datamapping/). Due to the nature of these data, we are not sharing them publicly here. If you would like to request access to these data, please contact the NYU Public Safety Lab at questions@jaildatainitiative.org.

To execute the full code used to generate the analyses reported in "Voting From Jail," run the file execute.sh from the command line.

The Public Safety Lab uses the tools of data science and social science to support communitiesâ€™ efforts to improve both equity and efficiency in public safety outcomes. Communities and agencies interested in working with the Public Safety Lab can contact us at publicsafetylab@nyu.edu, or follow us at @publicsafetylab.
